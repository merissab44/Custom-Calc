# Custom-Calc

Welcome to my custom Calculator!!

My calculator is one that calulates your calories burned!


INSTRUCTIONS:

in order to calculate the calories burned you want to:

1.select the activity you did in the dropdown,
2.Enter how many minutes you performed this activity
3.Enter your weight in pounds.

How does it work? 
According to this article https://betterme.world/articles/calories-burned-calculator/#:~:text=The%20equation%20for%20the%20Exercise,%2F%20200%20%3D%20Total%20calories%20burned. calories burned is determined by the activity MET value x weight(kg) x duration of activity / 200. 

So my program gets the MET value of the acitivity that was inputted, the wieght you input and converts it into kilograms, and the duration. The values of the activities are preset and can be found on the website shared above.

Thank you for using my calculator and hope you enjoy!
